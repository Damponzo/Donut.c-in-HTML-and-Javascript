This is dobut.c coded in HTML and Javascript so you can paste this into your website in case you REALLY want an ASCII spinning donut

If you wanna know how to run this super awesome code just check out ''HOW TO RUN.md''

i was recording a tutorial on how to run this on OBS but the donut started spinning way slower than supposed to?? maybe it it my shit 4gb ddr2 comuputer that coulnd't bear the strenght of OBS and started fucking up, anyways i hope this spins faster than it does for me because if it doesn't im gonna crash out.
